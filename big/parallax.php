<p>Parallax has become increasingly in web design over the past few years. Originally a graphic effect used in video games, Parallax in terms of web design is the scrolling technique used to produce the illusion of depth on websites. The background or background image moves at a different speed than the text or other images on the web page. Parallax scrolling has had a very positive effect on user experience since its’ creation. It makes the viewers experience more interactive by activating animations as he or she scrolls through the site. This incites curiosity, makes page visits last longer, holds interest by using a story-telling approach, and directs visitors to calls to action.</p>

<p>While Parallax design sites may offer a better experience for the user, it is not always the case for the business. Parallax sites are almost always a single page versus several pages linked together as in most other sites. Having a single page with only one set of meta tags, one effective heading1 tag, and a single URL greatly effects the search engine optimization of the site. It will be displayed high on search engine results such as google or bing. Another downside to having a single page is that all the images and information are stored in one place which can make the page slow to load and discourage visitors from staying and exploring the whole site. Creating a parallax site can also be very complicated and time consuming because it often requires more advanced knowledge of CSS and JavaScript to implement the design correctly.</p> 

<p>There are some tools available to make this easier for the less experienced designer.
    Using plugins make it much easier to create a scrolling parallax site. Most of these plugins use jQuery or JavaScript, like Scrollmagic. Scrollmagic is one of the most popular jQuery plugins that let you fix, move or animate HTML elemnts as the user scrolls. Not only is it lightweight, and customizable, it also works for mobile too which is a huge bonus. ScrollMe is another highly rated plugin that requires no JavaScript whatsoever. It can scale, rotate, translate, and change the opacity of elements on the page by only using CSS.</p>

<p>In summary, there are many benefits to using a parallax design for your business but you will most likely take a hit when it comes to your SEO. Do not let the complexity of the design deter you because there are many plugins available to suit your every need and make it easier to create stunning visual effects for your site.
