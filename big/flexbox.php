<p>The Flexible Box Module, also known as Flexbox, allows for the creation of intricate layouts with ease and much more simplicity than styling with CSS. Sometimes this is achievable in just one declaration. It is a one-dimensional layout mode added to CSS3 that replaces limiting floats and tables which can be frustrating to work with and design. Traditional CSS uses a grid layout and is two dimensional which means it controls both rows and columns together. This can prove to be much more complicated. With Flexbox being one dimensional, means that it manages the layout one dimension at a time, in rows or columns. It is comprised of two axes. The main axis is a flex container that holds flex items and can be laid out horizontally or vertically. The other is the cross axis.</p>
<p>Flexbox is very easy to get started and even easier to use. With Flexbox you can finally center elements and easily manipulate inline elements. For most situations you will find you only have to use three main properties-align-items, justify-content, and display. Another great feature of Flexbox is that it is supported in all major browsers. As of 2015 it was estimated at 95.89% global support. It come with an autoprefixer that lets you specify which browser versions you want to use. When you use this autoprefixer it then automatically adds the vendor prefixes which you specify. You do not need to use syntax when using the autoprefixer which makes things even easier.</p>
<p>Overall Flexbox is a great alternative to using traditional CSS. In all my research I could not find many cons to using Flexbox, the pros greatly out weigh the cons. It allows you to create complex layouts with ease and non of the hassle that CSS can sometimes create. The best part is that you can use it on all modern browsers.
