<p>Shopping carts are essential for any online business selling merchandise. From a consumer’s perspective, online shopping carts are much like the real ones we use in everyday life when out shopping at stores. We place items in an online cart that we would like to buy and take them to checkout. Behind the scenes, however, online shopping carts do much more than simply holding one’s purchases. Depending on which software you choose, shopping carts can help the retailer keep track of inventory, take orders, help with catalog and customer management, and conduct secure transactions online. There are two kinds of shopping carts, hosted and self-hosted. It is important to know the difference between these so you can make the best choice for your business needs.</p>
<p>Hosted shopping carts are great if you just need the basics or don’t have much experience running a website. You simply purchase the software from the host company, and they will manage it. You can choose to set up a new site, use pre-made templates, or add the cart icon to your current site. Self-hosted shopping carts are software that you run yourself instead of being managed by another company. The advantage to using a self-hosted cart is that you can customize it to preform any tasks  you want. The downside is that they require more experience to run and can be difficult at times.</p>
<p>In today’s market there are plenty of great options for both hosted and self-hosted shopping carts. Some of the most popular are Shopify, Wix,, BigCommerce and Magneto. When choosing which is right for your business the main things you need to take into consideration are the various functions you need your shopping cart to preform and your software operating skill level.
