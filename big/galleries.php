<p>Having an image gallery on your website is extremely important for any business. Pictures of products and services allow customers to become familiar with your brand and offers them more detailed information. Websites with photo galleries generate more visitors and generally have more sales because of it because the customers can envision the products and services offered. Today there are many different options when it comes to adding an image gallery to your webpage. </p>
<p>One of the most widely used tools for creating image galleries is jQuery. jQuery is a small, fast, feature-rich Javascript library. Using jQuery allows you to easily create websites and apps with as little as a single line of code. With a regular JavaScript code it could take up to 20 lines to achieve the same result. It can produce stunning visual effects comparable to those of flash movies. Several of the largest companies on the web use jQuery, like Google, Microsoft, and even Netflix. jQuery is by far the most extendable out of all the other JavaScript frameworks and works across a wide variety of browsers which is very important. It essentially uses your main processor to process transitions whereas CSS uses a graphic card.</p>
<p>These days, CSS galleries are much less popular than jQuery but there are sill some viable simple CSS options available. Some of the best pure CSS based galleries are Hoverbox Image Gallery, CSS Image Slider with 3D Transitions, CSS3 Animated Image Gallery, Filtronio CSS3 Portfolio, Pure CSS3 image Gallery, CSS Lightbox Image Gallery, and Slide EA. There are some advantages that come with using a based gallery. It can actually be faster and you don’t have to use variable or math. That being said, it is much harder to maintain because you could have hundreds of lines of code whereas jQuery could wrap it up in just a few lines, but you add extra kilobites to your site.
