<p>When choosing between a responsive website and a mobile application, you need to think about what is best suited for your business. In my opinion, none is superior to the other, they simply serve different purposes. They both have their pros and cons and when considering which is right for you, there are a few things you need to take into consideration such as intended purpose, who will be using it, how often, and budget.</p>
<p>So what exactly is the difference? Responsive website allows users to view a webpage on a variety of devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Because it is just a single URL, mobile websites are cheaper to build and are easier to maintain and update. Responsive websites also reach a broader range of users because anyone with access to the internet can view the site. There is also no installation or download required to view responsive websites but you are not able to access them offline.</p>
<p>Mobile applications are usually extremely user friendly and are designed for frequent visitor use. However, they can only be accessed by smartphones or tablets. Today it is estimated that over 64% of people own a smart phone, and that percentage will continue to grow. So if you take those statistics into consideration, mobile applications still reach a very broad user audience. Mobile applications are also much more expensive to build and harder to maintain. They require a developer with a specific set of skills and licensing for app stores. But if you are aiming for a personalized experience for a frequent user, they are worth the money.</p>
<p>All in all it depends on what the needs of the business are and what you want your user experience to be. If your audience is visiting your site simply for location, hours, services, simple tasks like that, a responsive website may be your best option. If your users need accounts and have more personalized goals such as shopping, making appointments, or keeping track of data, a mobile app would probably be more beneficial. Taking your audience goals into consideration is best when making this decision.
